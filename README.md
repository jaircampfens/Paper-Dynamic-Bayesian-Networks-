Dynamic Bayesian Network for Urban Energy Transition – Winterthur Case Study

This repository contains the full modelling workflow, supporting files, and survey tools used in our study.

The project develops a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to explore transition pathways for Winterthur’s goal of achieving net-zero emissions by 2040.

The repository includes:

1. the DBN model file (GeNIe/SMILE format)

2. two Jupyter notebooks used for model elicitation and analysis

3. a Python script for survey-based CPT construction
